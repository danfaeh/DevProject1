# Overview

Definitely don't play this browser game, there will be no happiness playing this game.  You'll be really frustrated and it will make no sense.  <br>Seriously.  <br>Don't play this.<br>

This was was supposed to be a tower defense game.  Oh man, is this NOT a tower defense game.  The mark was missed, and by a mile.  <br>

<br>	trackArr[i].append(enemy);
